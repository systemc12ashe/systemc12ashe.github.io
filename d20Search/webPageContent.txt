History and Mission
During the Drexel University course CI 102, our group began the creation of D20 Search with the goal of creating a product that puts the needs of role players at the forefront. We have particularly focusde on the Dungeon Master in this effort, as well as new players.
The search functionality brings ease to what would be hours of searching through books and forums.
The dice roller brings access to rolls at the tips of your fingers. Any of us could forget to bring our dice to a session.
D20 Search aims to bring convenience and simplicity to the world of roleplaying with a modernized understanding that the world is online. While the traditional pen and paper and physical books are still an important part of the histry of tabletop gaming, integrating technology into these aspects of the game can improve the overall experience.
Staying in game and in character is easier than ever with these highly accesible and necessary tools.
