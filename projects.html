        Over the course of two terms, myself and three team members worked using
        Agile methodology to create a website we called D20 Search.The purpose
        of this website was to create an online resource for Dungeons & Dragons
        players by providing a digital dice roller as well as a search
        functionality. My roles were as developer and product owner. In this
        role I worked with my team on all aspects of the product to implement
        features as well as created wireframes and kept track of team progress.

        Over the course of this class, we were tasked to use Test-Driven
        Development to create a bank in Java. FOr this project, we used mutation
        testing, UML and other software engineering principles to simulate the
        creation of critical systems.

        This class challenged us to create a text adventure game using the
        Python programming language. I decided to create a game where you are a
        detective on the case, solving a murder. The program gives suggested
        inputs, validates them, and moves you through the story with text
        retrieved from a textfile.
