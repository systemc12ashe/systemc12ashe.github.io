    <p>
        Over the course of two terms, myself and three team members worked using Agile methodology to create a website we called D20 Search.The purpose of this website was to create an online resource for Dungeons & Dragons players by providing a digital dice roller as well as a search functionality. My roles were as developer and product owner. In this role I worked with my team on all aspects of the product to implement features as well as created wireframes and kept track of team progress.
